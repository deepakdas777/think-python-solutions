# Write an add method for Points that works with either a Point object or a tuple:
	# .If the second operand is a Point, the method should return a new Point
	#    whose x coordinate is the sum of the x coordinates of the operands, and
	#    likewise for the y coordinates.
	# .If the second operand is a tuple, the method should add the first element
	#    of the tuple to the x coordinate and the second element to the y coordinate,
	#    and return a new Point with the result.
