This was a bit harder, because I wasn't sure how much of the header to remove (or even where the header ended and the book began). I decided to just go with all the text occurring after the * * * START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK.... * * * . This still includes some text that probably isn't desirable, but I wasn't sure what other pattern I could use to let the program know that the text was beginning.
